Maybe use a set of colours in the faceted tenure-by-sex-and-age plot that's more different from the colours used in the previous graph for male/female/both?

Line width is a good idea, it's too bad there's not an easy way to smooth this (I tried some stuff but didn't succeed)

Dotplot is new (and nice). Gray background is good (could be slightly lighter??)

* something (size or alpha?) to indicate sample size? e.g. (15-29 years/earned doctorate is very noisy, maybe very small?)
* separate x-axis scales for each column?
* abbreviate y-axis labels (e.g. "Mathematics and computer information science" -> "Math and comp/info sci" ?)
* order categories other than alphabetical?

Most of the comments from the presentation have not been addressed effectively. It would have been nice if you could have dropped some of the stuff that is not contributing to your story.

Line width is a good idea, but your method for calculating line width is not explained, and the actual values seem crazy. I don't believe that Canada has more total workers aged 55-64 than 25-54, let alone 2.5 times as many. Also, it would be good to have the tooltip show a statistic on which line width is based, rather than the actual value for the line width.

The dot plot could still be improved (particularly with an indication of weights), and doesn't use the same age groups as elsewhere. But it does a much better job of telling a graphical story than other plots. It's not good that you let the red dots just hide the blue dots sometimes. And what is up with the complete lack of red for Math in the bottom left? Are there less 3 women in that category?

Maybe use a set of colours in the faceted tenure-by-sex-and-age plot that's more different from the colours used in the previous graph for male/female/both?

Line width is a good idea, it's too bad there's not an easy way to smooth this (I tried some stuff but didn't succeed)

Dotplot is new (and nice). Gray background is good (could be slightly lighter??)

* something (size or alpha?) to indicate sample size? e.g. (15-29 years/earned doctorate is very noisy, maybe very small?)
* separate x-axis scales for each column?
* abbreviate y-axis labels (e.g. "Mathematics and computer information science" -> "Math and comp/info sci" ?)
* order categories other than alphabetical?

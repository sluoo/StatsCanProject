Statistics 744 Final Project

For our project, we will be exploring employment related data from StatsCanada. For one of our plots, we will do a comparison of earnings by education in Canada and its provinces and territories. Additionally, we may analyze the relationship between education and unemployment rate as a time series. Lastly, a thorough analysis of Canada's labour characteristics such as wage, gender, age group and wage with respect to industries will be conducted. Some of the plots we have in mind are spatial data, animated plots and time series. Maybe more to come??

**BMB: these three general areas sound reasonable. It's quite short on detail at this point. It would be nice to see a tentative outline of how you think you'll represent the data in each of the three areas/plots you're proposing.  Which ones will you try a spatial (mapping) representation for? "A thorough analysis" leaves a whole lot of room for what you're actually going to do ...

BTW, did you look at `?sunburstR::sund2bTooltip`? it seems to have detailed examples to show how to customize the tooltips ...**

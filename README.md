Statistics 744 Final Project

For our project, we will be exploring employment related data from StatsCanada. For one of our plots, we will do a comparision of earnings by education in Canada and its provinces and territories. Additionally, we may analyze the relationship between education and unemployment rate as a time series. Lastly, we look at industry specific characteristics such as wage, gender, age group, etc. Some of the plots we have in mind are spatial data, animated plots and time series. Maybe more to come??

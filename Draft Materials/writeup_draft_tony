Part II: Gender Pay Gap Analysis
__________________________________________

For these graphics, we look to explore some basic characteristics about the Canadian labour market, such as the age, gender, industry, and how the pay situation has changed over time. One topic that frequently comes up when people discuss labour data is the gender pay gap, which can generally be described as a discrepancy between how much men and women get paid for comparable work. Everyone has heard about the 70 cents to the dollar saying, but considering how people's pay differ depending on the industry and geography, it is beneficial to take a precursory glance at these sorts of variations to see how things actually work.

Geospatial Facet Plot - High-level overview
__________________________________________

To look at gender pay gaps, we combined industry and wage data obtained from the 2016 Census into an interactive, multi-faceted geospatial plot, coloured by the predominant field for each workfoace cohort. Looking at each educational level separately, we see that:
- At the College-level and below, business is the predominant field of study for all provinces and Yukon, and the trades/natural resources is the most common field in the NorthWest Territories and Nunavut.
- At the University Certificate level, the most populus provinces in Canada (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta) have business as the most common field of study, with the rest of the provinces and territories having Education as the most common field.
- At the Bachelor's degree level, Social sciences become the most common field in Ontario, British Columbia and the Yukon, and Business becomes the most common field of study in New Brunswick, but for all other provinces, the field of study remains the same as the University Certificate level.
- Geographical Industry trends at the Master's degree level largely resemble those at the University Certificate level, with the exception of New Brunswick and Manitoba
- At the Doctorate level, sciences are the single most common field of study in every province and territory; however, it is interesting to note that this is for the physical sciences (i.e. biology, chemistry, and physics), meaning that this does not include mathematics and computer sciences.

Now that we have an idea of what the most common fields of study are in different provinces and territories, we can look at the gender balance within each of these fields as well as any gender pay gaps. They can be briefly summarized as follows:
- Where Business and administration is the predominant field, females generally make up between 40 to 80 percent of that particular cohort, with the proportion of females generally declining as the education level goes up. There appears to be a universal gender pay gap across all provinces that goes anywhere between 7% (minimum value, in Prince Edward Island at the Bachelor's level) to around 24% (as observed in Alberta at the Master's degree level).
- In provinces and territories where Education is the most common field of study, females make up at least 60% of that particular cohort. For people with Master's degrees, Nunavut and Prince Edward Island have slightly greater median pay levels for females than males, though the difference is very small. In other areas where education is the most common field, the median salary of males is greater than that of females, though this difference ranges from slight (Nova Scotia, Master's degree level) to substantial (e.g. Saskatchewan, University certificate level).
- Science disciplines are the predominant field of study at the doctorate level across all genders. In all provinces, females make up between 30 to 45 percent of the Science PhD cohort, and with the exception of Nova Scotia, males have a greater median salary in all provinces than females. The territories have so few Sciences PhDs that with the exception of males in the Northwest Territories, Statistics Canada actually does not provide wage data. No inferences can be made for these regions given the small number of relevant individuals.
- Social sciences are predominant at the Bachelor's degree level for only two provinces and one territory. These cohorts are roughly 60% female and there appears to be a consistent and rather sizable gender pay gap in favour of males across all three of these jurisdictions. 
- The trades, services, natural resources and conservation fields have very low female representation (roughly 30%), and a pay gap of either 10 percent (Nunavut) or 25 percent (Northwest Territories) in favor of males.

Geospatial Facet Plot - How Plots were Made, Pros and Cons
___________________________________________________________

At this point, it's reasonable to ask how this plot was made and what the advantages and trade-offs are. We begin by discussing the construction of the plot:

The data we used comes from two datasets of the 2016 Census, one of which covered wages of individuals by gender and field of study (Table XX), and one of which tallied the number of employees by various factors such as industry, gender, field of study and earned qualifications. The wage data from statistics Canada was extracted from the source data, a 6GB CSV file, using a workstation desktop with the necessary system resources to do so. These datasets were combined and used to create a five facet geospatial plot using the simplified digital boundary files. The use of digital boundary files rather than detailed cartographic files accelerates the rendering process and reduces the final file size, albeit at the cost of some information about the northern territories' islands. For the purposes of this analysis, this appears to be fine.

The viridis "C" or "plasma" color scale was used for brightness and high contrast, not uniformity. Though the levels of the factors are not directional, these colors are still bright enough and distinctive enough such that they are suitable for distinguishing the different fields. It was decided to facet the geospatial data by education levels in order to best see how education levels may be related to the fields and location, and the rest of the information on cohort sizes, female representation, and salaries by field and gender were added into the hover tooltip through the use of several dummy aesthetics.

The advantage of the spatial plot is that it allows people to immediately identify the largest educational cohort within each province, and see some useful information about demographics and median pay within that cohort should they desire to. That is, this graphic provides a very brief high-level overview for those who are not interested in aggregated national level data, but want to get an idea of what they may expect when they look at regional-level data. However, we do acknowledge that doing things this way, while being a non-invasive way to present large amounts of data on the most common industries within each province or territory, does have limitations:

- First, this plot only shows relevant information for the largest field of study. The issue here is that if there are two educational cohorts that both make up, for example, around 40 percent of the total population for that province, the smaller of the two will not be shown.
- Secondly, there is currently no built-in mechanism to simultaneously pinpoint multiple entries at once. This makes it tedious to make multiple comparisons.
- Third, there is an argument to be made that province-level data may not be as relevant as the national-level difference between different age groups.
- As a technical point, the hover only really works when you go over the edges of the polygon. We suspect this is an issue with how ggplotly interacts with ggplot in the creation of traces, though we were unfortunately unable to correct this behaviour. 

Overall, it seems that we do need to take a more in-depth look at the situation given what we have seen.

Median Wages by Industry, Education Level and Age - National-Level View
________________________________________________________________________

Given the considerations we noted above, it was decided that a single static plot, with multiple facets for different industries, age groups, and education levels for national-level data, would allow us to somewhat address all of the issues at hand. Data was sourced again frome the 2016 census, except this time, age information was retained and since we are no longer interested in cohort sizes, it was possible to source all of the information from the 2016 Census, Catalogue No. 98-400-X2016280 (Statistics Canada, 2018)

For the purposes of this analysis, we are simply interested in whether there is a consistent pay gap or not based on the factors that are most likely to cause pay variations. Given that three are a large range of possible salaries for different fields of study and educational levels, a log scale was chosen for the horizontal axes for income. Faceting was done by placing education levels as parallel rows and age groups vertically, as each facet by itself is read left to right and sailent comparisons are generally not made between education levels for this topic, but rather between different age groups within the same education level. Colors were selected on the basis of common associations for each gender and to maximize contrast on the background, which was darkened and spaced out to help the reader distinguish between separate facets. Gridlines were included by default and kept as they seem to help somewhat in tracking which values belong to which fields. Finally, fields were left in reverse alphabetical order as there is no way to consistently and naturally order this particular factor. This plot has the advantage of simplicity and clarity at the expense of losing regional-level information in favour of national-level information, but as region may not be as important of a predictor in the preliminary stages of exploratory analysis, this trade-off may be worthwhile for the detailed information it provides.

Looking at this facet plot, we see that:

- The gender pay gap seems to be the least prominent for the 15 to 29 year old age cohort. Whele the differences are slightly in favour of Males at the College level, and somewhat in favour of females at the Doctorate level, the difference at other levels of Education for this cohort, while technically in favour of males, is extremely small. 
- For those aged 30 to 59, there is a consistent pay gap in favour of males across virtually every industry and education level up to the Master's degree level. While there are some exceptions where females are paid similarly, the gender pay gap appears fairly persistent across a variaety of circumstances. While there is a pay gap at the doctorate level that generally favours males, the picture is not as clear. 
- At the 60+ age group, we notice that the gender pay gaps are still present, but are far more erratic than those in other age groups. While pay gaps at different educational levels still seem to favour males, these trends are much less consistent across both educational lebels and industries.
- In terms of industries, health care at the University Certificate, Bachelor's degree and Master's degree consistently offers comparable pay to both genders. However, at the College level, there is a persistent pay gap in favour of males at all education levels, while at the doctorate level and adove the 15-29 year age brackets, there is a persistent pay gap in favour of females that enlarges at the 60+ age group. Otherwise, there are few consistent trends with respect to industry.

Overall, based on the national level data, we see that there is a persistent gender pay gap across a variety of settings and industries, but the picture is not very clear cut. It seems that the strongest trend appears to be the appearence of a pay gap for those at the university level after the 15 to 29 year bracket that persists well into the working years, but narrows as workers approach the age of 60. It is entirely possible that the observed trends are the result of some sort of "motherhood penalty", where younger women upon having children get treated differently and "lose out" on pay increases and promotion (Budig & England, 2001), but work experience gained over time may reduce these differences as workers get older. A more detailed analysis will be needed if we are to check the validity of this conjecture
